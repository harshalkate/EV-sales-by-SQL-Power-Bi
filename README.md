🚗🔌 EV Sales Data Analysis 🔍📊


I recently completed an Electric Vehicle (EV) Sales Data Analysis using SQL and Power BI, focusing on key metrics such as:


📅 Date: Tracked sales trends over time, identifying seasonal and annual fluctuations in EV sales.


🌍 State: Analyzed sales distribution across regions, identifying high-performing states driving EV adoption.


🚘 Vehicle Class, Category & Type: Assessed the popularity of different vehicle classes (SUVs, sedans, etc.), categories (luxury, economy), and types (battery electric, hybrid) to uncover consumer preferences.


📈 EV Sales Quantity: Measured sales performance, highlighting the growth of EV sales in key markets and identifying opportunities for market expansion.


💡 Using these insights, I was able to visualize trends and support data-driven decisions for optimizing sales strategies and market targeting.
